#rspec_init

This is a self-note for future me, in case if I forget how to setup `rspec` for
ruby project.


## Setup

Firstly, make sure you have `rspec` gem installed.

```sh
$ gem install rspec
```

Secondly, under ruby project, run the following command to initialize `rspec` setup.

```sh
$ rspec --init
```
